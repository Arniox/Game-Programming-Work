- Added menu sounds, and basic ingame music plus some basic other sounds. Made them controllable with channels and channel groups.
- Two channelsGroups exist, one for the menu and one for ingame
- Inside the ingame channelGroup, there are two channels. One for effects and one for music. This allows me to pause them individually. Although atm, this is kinda buggy so when I pause, I actually just pause the entire ingame sounds channel group or change the entire group volume.
- Added button noises

Last push for the night

- Made sure the files from debug where the same in release after all my changes

Tomorrow TODO:
- Add simple AI by abstracting out the player entity into an Actor with child classes as player and enemy.
- Add sound to fulfil the requirements
- Add some form of basic level. Probably just constantly spawning enemies and weapons.

- Added selectable button states so now the keyboard, mouse and tomorrow, the controller can control the buttons properly. Also added the proper exit button so that it will exit the game.
- Updated the button sprite sheet so that it was more visible when you select a button. It has a nice little blood splatter as well on the button when hovered which was accidental but turned out quite cool

Found the issue as to why the debug build was so laggy. I think it has to do with the way the debug mode treats vectors and iterators possibly. I simply reduced the bullet count on the minigun down to 200 instead of 20,000 and since every single entity is put into one array and then iterated through when doing quadtree inserts, in debug mode this must be insanely performance intensive. Reducing the count to 200 has allowed the debug build to become playable. On monday the minigun will only have 20 bullets anyways, so this wont be a problem

Final push for the night

- 0 Warnings, 0 Errors, 0 Memory leaks.
- Perfect warning level 3 build.

Unfortunately, due to how the debug build of visual studio and C++ works, with the way I am querying 5 times per frame, and doing very complex quadtree inserts, debug mode ingame runs at about 1 frame per second or less. I will try fix this or just reduce it from querying so often but on release build, this performance is butter smooth at 60fps with highly accurate tests so I would rather leave it as is and not use debug mode unless I am trying to find specific variables or find out why a crash happens.
I will alter some data so that on monday, I can show the gold build with no issues.

Last push for the night.

- Did more work on the main menu and mostly got it finished. Started adding some HUD elements. Right now there is FPS, PPS (processes per frame), and Entities being processed / total entities
- Did some work on the bullet class and made both Kill() and IsDead() a global entity function so that they could be used by any other entity
- A few more small optimizations on the quadtree and processing overall. Unfortunately, with how fast the bullets move, there isn't a good, cheap way to make sure they don't tunnel through walls. I could technically just do quadtree inserts as many times per frame as I am doing processing but this is quite intensive and may drop frames the more entities being processed. Right now my quadtree is running butter smooth so I don't really want to touch it. So in order to fix bullets tunnelling and escaping the map and then being forever processed as they fall down forever, I have a BindEntity function in the physics engine that simply kills an entity instantly when it leaves the screen.

- Some small work on other scenes for optimization and etc.
- Removed unused button png image
- Added sprite sheet for button

- Work on the main menu.
- Updated the unlickedButton.png
- Added some text centre options for text drawing. Especially useful for buttons
- Add some more stuff to weapons and magazines. There's a small bug although I really don't care too much, where bullets will sometimes, if they're fast enough, tunnel through walls. Again this isn't that worrisome.
- Added and starting working on a main menu scene
- Added some huge optimizations to the quadtree. Previously, when the parent quad filled up, it would simple insert into the children with the next point whilst keeping it's own points map still full. What this meant is that when a query occurred, it was technically having to query 5 total quads for each quad. I've fixed this with a RemoveInsert function that, on a quad divide, removes the parent entities and puts them inside the children.

There definitely needs to be some more optimisations at a later date. Allowing all bullets to constantly be processed should, in theory, with the quadtree allow for it to process easily with no lag, yet it drops quite a lot. Deletions and constantly clearing things needs to be fixed up later

- Increased max bullet bounce count from 2 to 5
- Increased max bullet count on the minigun temporarily for fun cause it looks awesome spraying bullets everywhere with the quadtree constantly drawing quads everywhere.

- Quadtree optimisations: The query function is now run outside of the time-stepped processing function. This assumes that a quad or area will remain mostly stable and the same positions. The time steps is simply to calculate collisions at a more accurate level. Now with the time-stepped processing, and the quadtree combined, the fps is much better. Although, if there is time; and I'll speak to the lecturer about it; there are some optimizations I could work on. For example, instead of deleting everything, every single quadtree clear, I could just overwrite.

- Quadtree optimisations: The quadtree now has a maximum depth variable that I can set. Right now this is at 4 and it seems quite stable. The more increased this is, the deeper it can subdivide. However, this was needed as when all the bullets where in one single area, at the same point, it kept subdividing over and over trying to split them into separate quads. This was only an issue when there was a lot of entities

- Optimisations: The time-steps (which I am naming ticks from now on) have been reduced to 5 per frame. 10 was nice, and still runs very well, but is not necessary and 5 ticks per frame is easily enough to get accurate collisions so it has been reduced.

Some other small changes where made.

- Started work on finishing the quad tree.
- Added a BBPointReference class. This is a backwards reference to an entity and a given bounding box as a singular point. For each entity, 2 BBPointReference's will be stored in the quad tree. One for the top left and one for the bottom right corners of the bounding boxes of each entity. What this means is that I can just query a given points quadtree to find 4 other points. Each of those points are connected to a greater BoundingBox but now, with that idea in mind, the singular point only has two check 3 other bounding boxes for collisions.

Each entity will, for both of its reference points, check the quad trees that those points exist in.
So the pseudo code for the query is:

QueryThisPoint(BBPointReference)
Check if this entity, attached to this point, collides with any of the 3 other entities' colliding boxes referenced points in my quad/area.
If not, then return;
If yes, then return list of collisions;

- Previously the force being applied was dis-proportionate to the time steps and would massively increase as time steps went down. This has been corrected and the force being applied is ALWAYS scaled off of the base deltaTime whilst velocity, and position is applied with normal physics calculations; scaling off of the processed deltaTime.
- More optimisations. I will have to add a quadtree at this point. With only 28 entities on screen, the amount of checks being done right now is N^2 so a total 784 checks per individual time step. A total 39200 checks every single frame if the time steps are at 50. My current optimisations bring this down to about 4000 when all the bullets are currently on screen. A quadtree would improve the complexity time to N*Log(N) so with 28 items, this would be about 41 checks meaning a total of 2050 checks every single frame at 50 time steps, or just 410 at 10 timesteps. This would hugely improve my processing time per frame and with my current optimisations this could be as low as 100 checks per frame.

- Removed un-needed sounds
- Added a bunch of sounds that will be used in future
- Angle of throw and angle of bullets firing is now correct. I will add some random angle increments depending on the gun so the bullets are not so accurate
- Some optimisation has been done to try and make the fps better when there's lot of bullets. Now when a bullet bounces up to a certain limit (now 2) it will stop being processed altogether but will still be drawn allowing for bullets to build up over time.
- Reduced the time steps. I need to play around with the forces because at lower time steps, the forces become weirdly quite small.
- Added extra guns to test to the ingame scene.

- More work on bullet mechanics. Bullets now correctly spawn with a fire rate and will not spawn anymore if they're all currently alive. I plan to add a permanent death functionality so there is a physically limited amount of bullets per weapon you can pick up.
- Bullets now correctly spawn at the tip of the gun and rotated 180 degrees off of the current angle which will be easy to fix

Alot more work on the "use" of weapons.

- Added some corrections to the sprite rotations for entities that need it. There is now a flipSprite SDL_RendererFlip variable for all sprites that is default NONE but entities like weapons will correctly flip so matter what direction they're facing, it always looks like they're facing up.
- Added a case in entity processing unit that continues out of a loop if the current entity being processed is a weapon and is attached because in this state, the given entity should not collide with anything or move with gravity.
- Instead, within the weapon processing function, if a weapon is attached to something, the weapon will move and rotate off that given entity based on the mouse pointer and attached entity position
- Input handler GetMousePos now returns a smart Vector2 pointer.
- Fixed some vector2 math and then reverted it.
- Reduced the time steps for the physics engine to 50 instead of 100. This doubles performance and the change is visually not that noticeable
- Tried to fix some impulse mechanics not allowing multiple entities to stack but gave up because it wont be that useful or problematic to my game
- Weapon class now has an attach, de-attach and attachment class/data. Each weapon keeps track of if it's attached to something and what it's being attached to and the entity processing unit now detects when a weapon collides with a player or enemy and attaches the weapon to the given entity. Will add a throw button to de-attach the weapon later.

Next to add is bullet mechanics and then AI

More work on weapons and implementation of correct attachment and physics

- Added some more customisability to animating sprites so they can rotate (this is WIP)
- Added a bunch of code to the weapon class. A weapon can now display
- Added the following weapon sprites:
  - Ak47
  - ChainSaw
  - GrenadeLauncher
  - HomingLauncher
  - LMG
  - MiniGun
  - Pistol
  - PumpShotgun
  - RailGun
  - Remington
  - RocketLauncher
- Also added a sprite sheet of a bunch more guns incase I want to add more later. Might also not get all of the above weapons implemented in time, but the goal is to get at least the shotgun, pistol, minigun and LMG working for the gold build

- Fixed a few more bugs and memory leaks although there's still a few

Message:
- Updated and fixed sprite images/gifs/sprite sheets and made them higher quality and reduced the size of the sprites individual frames
- The sprite creation is now done through the animatedsprite.cpp class which does all the processing and correctly calculates the frame height and width based on the total image size and frame count. That way there's only 2 int constants that in the player class to reduce the amount of mess
- Animated sprite now correctly also uses "currentPanel" which determines the height of the sprite row/frames so that I can have multiple sprite animations happen in one single 2D sprite sheet.
- Player class has been updated to reflect these changes
- Not moving now correctly runs the not moving animation
- Moving right and moving left now correctly run the moving right and moving left animations respectively
- Backbuffer has been updated to reflect these new changes. So now the sprite is drawn correctly with the correct size, frame, animation and etc and the bounding box now also scales correctly around that one singular frame.

Just to note:
- The game is now fully ready to start adding weapons, AI and effects. The physics engine can now process any given type of entity correctly. Custom code must be added to allow for picking up of weapons and a function: AttachItem() will be created to allow the player or AI to use weapons.

Massively reformatted a lot of the engine.
- Added an entityProcessingUnit which handles all the processing for every single entity against every other entity
- This effectively shorted the processing and handling that the physics engine itself does by about 50-100 lines.
- This also shorted the amount of work a scene has to do for processing by 10-20 lines
- New formatting means that a single processing unit can handle every single entity, no matter the type of material of said entity.
- This also splits up the execution of physical processing into two separate functions called ProcessEntityVelocity and ProcessEntityPosition
- In between the two, the entityProcessingUnit checks for collision and now has the ability to resolve a given collision in many different ways other than surface resolution

- Removed unused/unnecessary variables in the entity material class and just added one new enum for the entity type to determine if a given entity is a certain type and needs to collide in a certain way.

Message:
Gravity slightly increased to increase weight of movement.
Jump and movement can now only be done when the player is on the ground and never when in air. Momentum from a jump is carried though and the character will have parabolic jump curves from naturally occurring forces.

The physics engine also allows any other forces to affect the character that I want. I might add blackhole grenades, or wind or magnetic bullets or something.

Message:
Added wall textures back.
They use a custom draw method now instead of the entity draw method

Added customisation on the backBuffer end to check whether an entity wants to rotate around the 0,0 point or width/2, height/2
All normal entities will rotate around width/2, height/2 so rotateNull is true. But walls will rotate around 0,0 so rotateNull for them is set to false

Debug lines temporarily left in.

Added full bound walls to finish off the scene. Physics is now 100% complete at this point.

Next step probably on friday or over the weekend is to add the splash screen, add the main menu and add the weapons and maybe some particles
I want to get at least the splash screen and main menu done by next week come monday, as well as putting the wall textures back in with proper rotations.

Physics now fully works and collides with multiple walls at once and correctly from any given angle. There originally was a funny bug where the character could only collide down and right but it turned out to be because the central point of the entities weren't being updated.
Now they are and collision works correctly. Just need to implement force culling for when you're in the air now

Starting to add collision detection back in with extremely accurate detection.
Collision resolving is now WIP

Also, fixed MASSIVE memory leak that dumped so much memory it took over a minute to finish dumping.
This was a very obvious memory leak but I was previously not creating new rectangles every frame, I was only creating them once. Now some of the collision math
creates new rectangles that weren't being deleted correctly.
